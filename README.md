Name: “Looking to Jam”
Purpose of the site is to give musicians the ability to connect with other bands and find new band members. Users will be able to post and comment on forums and search for members close to them and set up times for meet ups. We plan on using Google Maps and Google Calendars.  

Tasks:
Eric and Anthony are working on the Front End
Zachary and Emma are working on the Back End
